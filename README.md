On task 2 after clicking enable light it will be seen as complete dark. After clicking enable light once you click ambient light slider you can adjust the light.
There is a minor bug on task4. After you add first and second texture, you have to add a different picture to second texture and then click blend. It blends the picture after that. I couldn't fix the bug
